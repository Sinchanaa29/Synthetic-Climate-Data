Synthetic Data and Geospatial Visualization: New Frontiers in Climate Research 

For centuries, we have depended on clocks to gauge time, directing our lives by seconds, minutes, and hours. In this era of unprecedented climate change, it is crucial to develop a new type of clock, a climatic clock, to highlight and convey environmental issues. Although historical climate data offers important insights, it frequently lacks accuracy, consistency, and availability, which restricts our capacity to make well-informed decisions. This research tackles these shortcomings by generating synthetic data to produce accurate, consistent, and comprehensive climate datasets.
Focusing on variables such as average temperature, CO2 emissions, and renewable energy use, we adopt computationally efficient methods like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Copulas to generate realistic synthetic datasets. These techniques preserve statistical properties while minimizing resource demands. Validation metrics such as Wasserstein distance and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests ensure synthetic data aligns with real-world distributions. Predictive compatibility is further tested using regression-based models to confirm the usability of synthetic data in analysis.
Geospatial tools like Looker Studio are employed to compare real and synthetic datasets. These visualizations enable the detection of trends, anomalies, and regional variations in climate data, offering deeper insights into underlying patterns. By bridging gaps in historical climate records and enhancing predictive modeling, this research highlights the value of synthetic data in addressing critical global challenges.
Through a combination of advanced machine learning methods, rigorous statistical validation, and insightful visualization, this study provides a scalable framework for addressing data limitations. It empowers researchers and policymakers to make informed decisions, accelerating efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change.
